## Contributing Guidance - v3

* Target your pull requests to the **version-3** branch
* Add/Update any docs articles related to your changes
* Include a test for any new functionality and ensure all existing tests are passing by running `npm test`
  * If you are fixing a bug, include a test that would have caught the bug you are fixing
* Ensure tslint checks pass by typing `npm run lint`
* Keep your PRs as simple as possible and describe the changes to help the reviewer understand your work
* If you have an idea for a larger change to the library please [open an issue](https://github.com/pnp/pnpjs/issues) and let's discuss before you invest many hours - these are very welcome but want to ensure it is something we can merge before you spend the time :)
