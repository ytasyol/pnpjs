The PnP "Sharing Is Caring" initiative teaches the basics around making changes in GitHub, submitting pull requests to the PnP & Microsoft 365 open-source repositories such as PnPjs. 

Every month, we provide multiple live hands-on sessions that walk attendees through the process of using and contributing to PnP initiatives.
